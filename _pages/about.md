I'm a second-year master's student at the [Institute of Zoology](http://www.ioz.ac.cn/), [University of Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://www.ucas.ac.cn/). My research interests include bioinformatics.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Liu](https://ioz.cas.cn/sourcedb/zw/zjrc/200907/t20090716_2088450.html) at the Liu Lab, [Institute of Zoology](http://www.ioz.ac.cn/), UCAS. I was previously advised by [Prof. Du](https://zhibao.swu.edu.cn/info/1118/6374.htm) from southwest university.
